A simple Express server built with TypeScript that implements three routes:

1. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install all dependencies:

npm install

2. Run the server
To run the development server with TypeScript directly, use:

npm run dev 

This will run the Express server on http://localhost:5000.

3. Accessing routes 

go to http://localhost:5000/api/name  - Returns the full name.
      http://localhost:5000/api/hobby - Returns a JSON object containing your favorite hobby.
      http://localhost:5000/api/dream - Returns a motivational message about your dream or goal in life.

4. Building for production 
    npm run build
    npm run start
